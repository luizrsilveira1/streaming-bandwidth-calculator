## [0.1.0] - 2023-03-21

Early refactoring to use NPM standard with package.json. Sorry, I'm not a programmer. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

### Added

- Added a package.json file.
- On package.json, "Type": "module", so we can use import instead of require. It is necessary once the library should work both on browsers and Node.js
- Refactoring the file structure.

### Removed

- Removed all "Node.js only" file and folders, once the current version works with both systems with the same files.

## [0.0.1] - 2023-03-21

This is the first usable version, although it's not an official release.

### Added

- Added a front-end version, which uses the "js-script.js" file and "js-modules" folder with its subfolders.
- Added a back-end version, which uses the "node-modules.js" file and "node-modules" folder with subfolders.
- Added "index.html" and "YOUR-FRONTEND-CODE.js" as example of how to use the library on the front-end.
- Added "YOUR-NODE-CODE.js" as example of how to use the library on the back-end.
