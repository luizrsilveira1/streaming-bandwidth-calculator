# A library to convert magnitudes
## Examples:
- Bits to Bytes
- Bytes to Bits
- Handle and convert different unit types: Binary (Kibi, Mebi, etc) and Decimal (Kilo, Mega, etc)

## Description:

The chosen approach in this library is to convert the input value to bits, regardless of the system (Binary or Decimal), magnitude (Mega, Mebi, Giga, Tebi, etc.), or type (Bytes or Bits) it came in, and then convert the raw bit value to the final unit selected by the user.

## How to use:

### Front-end implementation:

If you want to use this project inside your .js file, import the library as follows:

```
import { calculator } from "./script.js"
```

If you want to use this project right through your HTML file, import the library at the end of the "<body>" tag, as follows:

```
<body>
...your html code...
<script src="./script.js" type="module"></script
</body>
```

Inside the "examples" folder, "index.html" and "YOUR-FRONTEND-CODE.js" provides an example of how to use the libray on the front-end.

### Back-end implementation:

For Node.js, import the library as follows:

```
import { calculator } from "./script.js"
```

Inside the "examples" folder, "YOUR-NODE-CODE.js" provide a simple example of how to use the library on the back-end.

## Changelog:

### Last update: [0.1.0] - 2023-03-21

Early refactoring to use NPM standard with package.json. Sorry, I'm not a programmer. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

#### Added

- Added a package.json file.
- On package.json, "Type": "module", so we can use import instead of require. It is necessary once the library should work both on browsers and Node.js
- Refactoring the file structure.

#### Removed

- Removed all "Node.js only" file and folders, once the current version works with both systems with the same files.
